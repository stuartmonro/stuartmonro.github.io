## The Agent

We are going to be travelling with Regal Dive. Our contact there is Cath Bates and [the Regal Dive website is here](https://www.regal-diving.co.uk/){:target="\_blank"}

## Deposit Requirements

To confirm a place on the trip you need to pay a deposit to Regal Dive using quote reference 203857. The deposit amount is £356 which is less than 10% of the total payable, this is because not all of the costs have been finalised yet.

Payment can be made over the phone or by bank transfer, bank transfer is the preferred method. The bank details are on the quote which is available from the link below, they are also here:

| Title | Details |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Bank Name | Barclays |
| Account Name | The Natural Travel Collection Ltd (agent recommends abbreviating to TNTC Ltd |
| Sort code | 20-97-19 |
| Account No. | 13777049 |
| Reference | 203857 |
 
*Before making any deposit payment, please read the quote in full. Pay special attention to the section on travel insurance.*

Please also note that the quote and booking plans are based on 6 people travelling, for this reason please do not share this information with anyone else outside the established group. If other people want to join the trip, please ask them to contact Stuart to discuss it.

Stuart has provided Cath with a list of all our names and she will coordinate with him to confirm when you have paid your deposits. Please can you let Stuart know when you send the money over so he can keep an eye on things from our side.

## The Quote

The quote document received from Regal Dive [is available at this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/180PEIOMUMiKVHkLoRtyrnRAChZJHsLFy/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"}

There are a few points to note on the quote:
- On page 4, the second line of the itinerary should show the departure point as Dubai, not Doha. Cath has confirmed this is a typo and she will amend it before the next version of the quote is issued
- The B&B status of the Blue Lagoon has changed, breakfast is included up to the value of $10 (USD) per person. Apparently we'll have to work really hard to exceed that
- The interim payment for the flights from Manila-Chuuk (rtn) are because those are booked with United Airlines, they cannot be held without payment and so have to be paid for as soon as they are booked
- Please note that the payment schedule on the quote has been superseded by the one in email 8 and replicated here:
	- Initial deposit (payable as soon as possible)
	- Interim payment for Manila - Chuuk flights 10 months prior to departure
	- Balance 60-90 days prior to departure

<span style="color:#B40404">
VERY IMPORTANT - PLEASE NOTE: the total price per person that has been quoted (£4065.50) is based on *estimated* flight costs. It isn't possible for Cath to confirm what those costs will be until closer to our date of travel, likely 10-11 months. Her estimate has been based on a 5% increase year on year calculated against current flight prices.

You must ensure you are happy with this level of uncertainty *before* you pay your deposit and commit to the trip. Payment of deposit will be taken as acceptance that the price may fluctuate.
