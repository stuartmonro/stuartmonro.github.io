# The Artists

## Aaron Smith
From Polmont (just outside Falkirk, the location of Scotland's young offenders institution), this guy has got some critics in a bit of a lather. He's basically one man and his piano, a singer-songwriter with all that entails. He's got a decent voice, very chilled. I wouldn't make an effort to get in early to see him but wouldn't avoid him if we were already in. 

This is Unconditional

## Automotion
From London and led by Liam Gallagher's eldest son Lennon Gallagher, this isn't the lad rock that his dad does. The music is rocky and interesting with a few nice bits of guitar work. Will they set the world on fire? Probably not, but we should go and see them.

This is them live a few months back

## Cash Savage and the Last Drinks
Very early 80's post punk. Good, worth seeing. From Melbourne, been on the go since 2008 the band's line tends to change with Cash Savage really been the only consistent member, but they've had good reviews over the years

This is Rat-A-Tat-Tat

## CMAT
A bit poppy, a bit country, inoffensive easy listening. Wouldn't avoid her, she's from Dublin and released her first album early in 2022. She calls herself a global pop star - I guess we'll see. 

This is Every Bottle is My Boyfriend

## Courting
Someone has been listening to Fontaines DC and Slaves. Punky, rocky and raucous. From Liverpool and worth seeing

This is them live in 2021

## Dora Jar
From California, Billie Eilish is a fan and Dora has been opening for her recently. Not getting into this at all, a couple of big sounds but mainly introverted warbling. Would need to be in the mood for this one

This is her live in 2021

## Ducks Ltd
From Ontario but spending a lot of time in Australia, there's a strong thread of 80's pop in this - highlighted by the fact they've covered the Jesus and MAry Chain (not fantastically well but at least they tried). The music is light rock, reasonable to listen to. We should probably give them a go. 

This is them live in March 2022

## Enumclaw
This copuld be quite good live or they might just disappear up their own backsides. Definitely worth checking them out to see which way they go. They're from Washington state and they've been described as "scuzzy indie rock". There's a bit of a Nirvana vibe about them, though the music isn't as good. 

This is Fast n All

## Ethan P Flynn
Originally from Yorkshire, he studied at the Guildhall School of Music and dropped out at 18, so clearly he's talented. The music is definitely interesting, not exactly jump up and down and shake your head bangers, but I reckon it'll be worth checking out. I wouldn't go in early just to see him though. 

This is Are You Doing This to Hurt Me?
