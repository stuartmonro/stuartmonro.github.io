# The Artists

## Aaron Smith
From Polmont (just outside Falkirk, the location of Scotland's young offenders institution), this guy has got some critics in a bit of a lather. He's basically one man and his piano, a singer-songwriter with all that entails. He's got a decent voice, very chilled. I wouldn;t make an effort to get in early to see him but wouldn't avoid him if we were already in. 

This is Unconditional
