Terminal - Virgin flights arrive in terminal A (side A). This is where the Virgin Holidays kiosk, car hire desk and VTP vending machine are.

We might need to go to the Virgin kiosk to get the villa details, otherwise we should be able to go straight to the car hire garage to pick up the car (after we've picked up the VTP thing).

## From the Skip the Queue doc

Upon arrival, proceed to Immigration and then be directed to the Customs Hall to collect your luggage from Virgin Atlantic baggage belts.

There is an option to put the luggage on the carousel belt after the customs hall to save having to carry it. Prevailing wisdom is to not do this as it can take hours to re-appear

Upon departing the shuttle, you will be tempted to follow the crowd to B side, please head to the fountain and make a right to the A side escalator to Level 1 and proceed to the Virgin Holidays podium. Apparently the A side is quieter.

If you have checked in online, you can proceed directly to the garage where you will be assisted by both a Virgin Holidays and Alamo representative.

Please make yourself known to the Virgin Rep at the podium on the A side for your villa directions before leaving the terminal.

### Visitors Toll Pass (VTP)

Remember to add the reg for the car into the VTP app. To do this, go to *Account > Trip Information > Update Licence Plate*. The advice that VTP have provided in response to a question about not telling Alamo that you're using VTP was this:

<span style="color:#B40404">
*In brief when you register your license plate on our app you get registered on our system. When you go through a toll it doesn't get immediately reported to the toll agency its program follows a type of waterfall system and our program is at the very top so when you go through a toll it gets reported to us 1st*
</span>

This addresses the concern about being double-charged by both VTP and Alamo. The response above indicates that VTP won't pass on the charge to Alamo so we don't need to worry about it.

Sometimes the tolls from VTP don't show up on the app straight away and so don't be too concerned if you don't see them for a few days. Make sure you check the receipt from the hire company when returning the car to ensure there are no "hidden" charges like toll pass or fuel.

### Car Hire Return

Regardless of what it says on the Virgin documentation, we've hired the car for a set number of days. The time we have to return it is defined by the time when we picked it up, with a 29 minute grace period.

So if we pick the car up at 5pm then we have to return it by 5.29pm on departure day.
