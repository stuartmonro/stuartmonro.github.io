# Arriving in MCO

Terminal - Virgin flights arrive in terminal A (side A). This is where the Virgin Holidays kiosk, car hire desk and VTP vending machine are.

We might need to go to the Virgin kiosk to get the villa details, otherwise we should be able to go straight to the car hire garage to pick up the car (after we've picked up the VTP thing).

## From the Skip the Queue doc

Upon arrival, proceed to Immigration and then be directed to the Customs Hall to collect your luggage from Virgin Atlantic baggage belts.

There is an option to put the luggage on the carousel belt after the customs hall to save having to carry it. Prevailing wisdom is to not do this as it can take hours to re-appear

Upon departing the shuttle, you will be tempted to follow the crowd to B side, please head to the fountain and make a right to the A side escalator to Level 1 and proceed to the Virgin Holidays podium.

If you have checked in online, you can proceed directly to the garage where you will be assisted by both a Virgin Holidays and Alamo representative.

Please make yourself known to the Virgin Rep at the podium on the A side for your villa directions before leaving the terminal.
