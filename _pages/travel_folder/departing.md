Terminal - Virgin flights arrive in terminal A (side A). This is where the Virgin Holidays kiosk, car hire desk and VTP vending machine are.

### Check In	

Disney Springs check in won't be open. Here's the guidance from Virgin:	To check in for your return flight you will need to do this 24 hours before your flight online, via our app or at the airport on the day. Your luggage will need to be dropped at the airport at the Virgin Atlantic check in zones.

### Visitors Toll Pass (VTP)

At the end of the trip, the pass can be put into a drop box inside the airport

### Car Hire Return

Regardless of what it says on the Virgin documentation, we've hired the car for a set number of days. The time we have to return it is defined by the time when we picked it up, with a 29 minute grace period.

So if we pick the car up at 5pm then we have to return it by 5.29pm on departure day.
