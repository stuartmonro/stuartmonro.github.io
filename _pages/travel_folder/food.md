# Breakfast

### Recommended

#### Cracker Barrel
According to Dibb they're _way_ better than IHOP for pancakes

Also good for lunch

#### First Watch
For breakfast and brunch. Recommended on Dibb

#### Cheddars Scratch Kitchen
The concept of the "scratch" kitchen seems to be taking off in the US. Basically it means a restaurant where they cook everything from scratch. Revolutionary!!

This is a chain that looks similar to Cracker Barrel and may be worth checking out

#### Bob Evans
Another one popular on the Dibb. There's one not far from where we stayed previously in Kissimmee

### Other Options

##### IHOP
Avoid the ones on I-drive and the one attached to a Days Inn, poor experiences on the Dibb

The one near Walgreens on the 192 and the one at Lake Buena Vista are both recommended, by very recent visitors from the Dibb (particularly LBV)

##### Panera Bread
A promising looking breakfast / brunch / lunch type option

# Burgers / Steaks / Americana

### Recommended

#### Longhorn Steakhouse
On I-drive, seems to be the one most frequently recommended. Decent prices and tasty side options

#### Teak Neighborhood Grill
Looks really good - burgers, sandwiches, tacos, salads and flatbreads

#### Culvers
Burger joint, lots of recommendations. Maybe not quite as varied as Teak but possibly lighter and cheaper

### Other Options

#### BJs

#### Manny's Chophouse

#### Logan's Roadhouse

#### Toojays


#### Rock n Brew
