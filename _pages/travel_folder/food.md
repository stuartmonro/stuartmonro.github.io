# Dole Whip

Really the only reason for going to Orlando at all! All the Dole Whip locations [are listed at this link](https://disneywithdavesdaughters.com/dole-whip-at-walt-disney-world/){:target="\_blank"}

# Breakfast

### Recommended

#### Cracker Barrel
Apparently they're _way_ better than IHOP for pancakes

Also good for lunch

#### First Watch
For breakfast and brunch. Recommended. 

[First Watch website](https://www.firstwatch.com/?version=core){:target="\_blank"}

#### Cheddars Scratch Kitchen
The concept of the "scratch" kitchen seems to be taking off in the US. Basically it means a restaurant where they cook everything from scratch. Revolutionary!!

This is a chain that looks similar to Cracker Barrel and may be worth checking out

[Cheddars Scratch Kitchen website](https://www.cheddars.com/home){:target="\_blank"}

#### Bob Evans
Another one popular on the Dibb. There's one not far from where we stayed previously in Kissimmee

[Bob Evans website](https://www.bobevans.com/menu/){:target="\_blank"}

### Other Options

##### IHOP
Avoid the ones on I-drive and the one attached to a Days Inn, poor experiences on the Dibb

The one near Walgreens on the 192 and the one at Lake Buena Vista are both recommended, by very recent visitors from the Dibb (particularly LBV)

##### Panera Bread
A promising looking breakfast / brunch / lunch type option

[Panera Bread website](https://www.panerabread.com/){:target="\_blank"}

# Independents

#### Yellow Dog Eats
Described as quirky, cozy, unique and difficult to find(!) reviews are pretty good. BBQ, sandwiches, wraps, tacos, nachos, salads and scooby snacks

[website](https://yellowdogeats.com){:target="\_blank"}

#### Maxines on Shine

Community café which gets really good reviews on Tripadvisor
- Brunch Friday - Sunday 10am-3pm
- Dinner  Thursday - Saturday 5pm - 9pm

Menus not available

[website](https://maxinesonshine.com){:target="\_blank"}


#### Pom Pom's Tea House and Sandwicheria

Tea (the drink) sandwiches and salads good reviews

[website](http://pompomsteahouse.com){:target="\_blank"}


#### Black Bean Deli

Cuban "comfort food" gets decent professional reviews, Tripadvisor is a little more mixed but also doesn’t have many reviews in general. May be worth checking out

[website](https://blackbeandeli.com){:target="\_blank"}


#### Tako Cheena

Mexican / Asian fusion that started as a food truck
Decent reviews and the menu looks interesting, sounds like it could be worth a visit if not too far away

[website](https://takocheena.net){:target="\_blank"}

#### Bosphorous Turkish Cusine

There are 4 of these - so something of a mini-chain. The lunch menu looks a bit limited (kebabs mostly), the dinner menu looks more interesting. Gets great reviews on TripAdvisor so could be worth checking out as something a bit different from the "typical" Orlando offering

[website](https://www.bosphorousrestaurant.com){:target="\_blank"}

#### The Mexican Camel

A "quick service" restaurant - so somewhere between fast food and normal sit down meals. This place sounds and looks like it's similar to Chipotle but gets great reviews on Tripadvisor. Appears to be a single location on I-Drive and they claim to mix Mexican and Mediterranean cusines, so could be interesting.

[website](https://themexicancamel.com){:target="\_blank"}

#### Tomatoes

Another Turkish / Mediterranean style place. Not many reviews on TripAdvisor and they're all 5 star. Either this place is very new or they're at it. Website also very limited so likely this place would only be worth trying out if it's local

[website](http://tomatoesrestaurants.com){:target="\_blank"}

#### The Gnarly Barley

American sandwiches, tacos and salads. They look like they could be quite good though and get good reviews

[website](https://www.thegnarlybarley.com){:target="\_blank"}

#### Ana's Brazillian Kitchen

Seems to be popular with the local Brazillian expats which has to be a good sign. Check their Facebook page for opening times and details of what's on the menu each day as it seems to change. Looks to be reasonably central and they also get good reviews

[website (Facebook)](https://www.facebook.com/anasbraziliankitchen){:target="\_blank"}

[website with menu](https://www.flowcode.com/page/anasbraziliankitchen){:target="\_blank"}

#### Border Grill Fresh Mex

Some good reviews on Tripadvisor, typical Mexican style place - burritos, enchiladas, quesadillas, tacos and so on. Not too far from Universal, not open on Sunday.

[website](https://mhme.nu/lp/bgfm){:target="\_blank"}

#### Q'Kenan

Apparently this is a very authentic Venezuelan restaurant. The menu looks interesting and the photos make it look like it could be worth a visit

[website](https://qkenan.com){:target="\_blank"}


# BBQ

## TripAdvisor top 3

### 4 Rivers Smokehouse
<span style="color:#FF0040">Recommended by Madeline</span> and one of the top 3 on Tripadvisor.

[website](https://www.4rsmokehouse.com/menu/){:target="\_blank"}

### Pig Floyds
Top recommendation on Tripadvisor but not sure if they're more a large catering type place

[website](https://www.pigfloyds.com/){:target="\_blank"}

### Ellie Lous
Another of the top 3 on Tripadvisor

[website](https://www.ellielous.com/){:target="\_blank"}

## Others

Might be a decent option if close but doesn't look spectacular

[website](https://lizziesbbq.com/){:target="\_blank"}

### Bubbalous
Recommended on Dibb but reviews are a bit mixed

[website](https://bubbalous.com/){:target="\_blank"}

### Smokey Bones
According to Dibb they do good ribs

### Polite Pig
Based at Disney Springs

[website](https://www.politepig.com/menu){:target="\_blank"}


# Burgers, Steaks and Americana

### Recommended

#### Longhorn Steakhouse
On I-drive, seems to be the one most frequently recommended. Decent prices and tasty side options

[Longhorn website](https://www.longhornsteakhouse.com/home){:target="\_blank"}	 	

#### Teak Neighborhood Grill
Looks really good - burgers, sandwiches, tacos, salads and flatbreads

[Teak website](https://www.teakorlando.com){:target="\_blank"}

#### Culvers
Burger joint, lots of recommendations. Maybe not quite as varied as Teak but possibly lighter and cheaper

[Culvers website](https://www.culvers.com/menu-and-nutrition){:target="\_blank"}

### Other Options

#### BJs
Might be worth a visit - big menu - maybe too big and varied to be good?
Pizza, burgers, pasta, chicken, steak, lighter stuff, seafood

[BJs website](https://www.bjsrestaurants.com/menu){:target="\_blank"}

#### Manny's Chophouse
Another burger and steak joint, recommended by a couple of people on Dibb
Winter Haven one less busy than Haines?

[Mannys website](https://www.mannyschophouse.com){:target="\_blank"}

#### Logan's Roadhouse
Steak and burger joint

#### Toojays
Looks a little bit different, crazy big sandwiches
Could be worth checking out

[Toojays website](https://www.toojays.com/location/orlando-restaurant-colonial-market-plaza/){:target="\_blank"}

#### Rock n Brew
Another chain, typical American food

[Rock n Brew website](https://www.rockandbrews.com/kissimmee#menu){:target="\_blank"}

### Sickies Garage
Looks like a good burger joint, may be worth checking out

[Sickies website](https://sickiesburgers.com/){:target="\_blank"}

### Hash House a Go Go
Hard to get an idea of the menu other than it looks like country food again (like Cracker Barrel and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen) highly recommended though on the Dibb. Some alternative suggestions on the Dibb that Hash Houses in general are quantity over quality

# Pizza

### Uno
Pizza and grill on International Drive

[Website](https://www.unos.com/menus/){:target="\_blank"}

### NYPD 
Pizza - takeout and sit in. This place consistently comes top on loads of different websites when rating places to eat in general, so we should probably check them out.

Japanese style steakhouse

[website](https://kobesteakhouse.com/menu/){:target="\_blank"}

- Snacks at Disney Springs [link to Disney Food Blog](https://www.disneyfoodblog.com/2022/03/21/9-of-the-best-snacks-under-10-in-disney-springs/){:target="\_blank"}

## Tipping

This post copied [from the Dibb](https://DIBB.in/15394761){:target="\_blank"} has a good explanation of tipping. The main take away is that even if the service is bad we should tip 10% because otherwise that comes out of the servers pocket as they have to square up with the back of house staff.

<span style="color:#0B610B">
I’m British; I live in Orlando and I’ve been a server for the past 5 years. I thought I’d give you an honest 1st person perspective on the whole tipping debate.
<br>Firstly, tipping is optional. Nobody is legally obligated to tip.
<br>I get paid minimum wage which is $10 an hour. When I’m interacting with customers (most of my hours) this drops to $6.98 an hour. For simplicity, I’ll refer to this as $7 an hour going forwards. The minimum wage in Florida is set to increase by $1 an hour for the next 5 years capping out at $15 per hour. This changes each year on Oct 1st.
<br><br>My wages wildly change from day to day and week to week. I’ll have a Tuesday where we are really busy and everyone is tipping well and then the next Tuesday it’ll be quiet and people just won’t be tipping either. I’d say the minimum I make in tips an hour is around $7 and the max is about $20. That puts my wages between $14 and $27 an hour. My average is around $12 so that puts me on $19.
<br><br>On a 40 hour week I’ll normally work 8x hours at minimum wage of $10 ($0 tips) and then 32 being tipped. At an average of $19, that gives me a weekly wage of $688. This equates to $35,776 per annum. This figure assumes I work 52 weeks a year with no vacation and no sickness.
<br>Because I work more than 32 hours a week I’m entitled to benefits. These are virtually all worthless. I get vacation pay equal to my average hours worked in a week over the course of a year, to a max of 40 hours. This is paid at minimum wage of $10. So if I take a weeks vacation I get paid $288 less than a normal working week. Additional time off is allowed, but unpaid.
<br>The other benefit I get is medical insurance. The plan offered is awful and it’s cheaper for me to arrange my own privately.
<br><br>I get no sick pay or bereavement pay. The average person takes around 3% sick days a year, which for a person working 5 days a week is 8 days. If I use this figure for me and let’s say I also take 10 days vacation for the year too, my annual salary drops from $35,766 to $33,690. Most of my colleagues live paycheck to paycheck and they simply can’t afford to miss work for any reason.
<br>My employer is legally obligated to insure that I get paid minimum wage so must top up my $7 if I don’t get tipped. However this never happens as it’s an average per hour worked for the shift and not individual hours. If I work an 8 hour day, 2x hours are normally at minimum wage and the other 6 are at $7. If my first 2 customers tip me a combined total of $20 then I’m already at an average of $10.25 for the shift. I could easily be working my remaining 5x hours at $7 an hour if nobody tips me.
<br><br>The whole 8% tax thing is a very grey area. It comes down to the employer or how the employee declares their income. I don’t do it this way, but some people will declare their tips at a straight 8% of their total sales for the day. When people do this and they don’t get tipped they are technically being taxed on wages they aren’t receiving. On the flip, they are also not paying tax when they receive more than 8%. It balances out give or take.
<br><br>Tipping a percentage. It’s hard to understand why a server gets paid more when they bring a more expensive meal to your table. They’ve done the same job either way. It comes down to how the restaurant is operated. Virtually everyone you see in the restaurant are working on $7 an hour. You tip your server directly, but they are just the middle person. At the end of their shift they are cashed out and the restaurant will take a predetermined amount off of the server to redistribute amongst the other staff there.
<br>The hostess, barman and busser all get a cut. The only fair way to distribute this money is on a percentage of the total sales taken as this is an auditable amount. As an approximation, it’s $5 per $100; regardless of how much the server was actually tipped.
<br><br>*So if your meal cost $150, your server will be paying other staff $7.50. If you don’t tip then they are still paying this amount. This is the reason why it’s a basic courtesy to tip 5% even if the service is bad. That tip won’t go to the server, but at least you’re not making them literally pay to serve you. Nobody should be paying to be at work, regardless of how bad they are.*
<br><br>If your average meal is $150 and you tip 20% which is $30 the server will get around $22.50. If you eat out the next night at a more expensive restaurant and your meal is $300 but decide that your server did the same amount as the server yesterday and was just as nice - so you again tip $30. In this instance your server is actually only getting around $15.
<br>It’s really easy to get caught up on how much a server has just been tipped and thinking that their hourly wage is too much. At that moment in time, I agree. However, there aren’t enough peak hours in a week to maintain that wage and so their average will be much lower. Then add in unpaid time off etc and that figure drops even more. The non tippers really mess this ‘hourly wage’ figure too as it’s too easy for a server to actually work an hour at -$’s if they get stiffed back to back.
<br><br>At a guess, I’d say that around 10% of customers don’t tip - regardless of service. Servers who consistently are bad at their job get stiffed even more. In the tourist area this will be higher as people aren’t likely to come back and don’t care.
<br>At the end of the day it’s your choice whether you tip or not. I hope I’ve been able to give you a small insight into how the system works here. Remember, tips are how your server pays their bills. Personally, I think it’s a stupid system.
