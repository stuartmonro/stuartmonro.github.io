# Breakfast

### Recommended

#### Cracker Barrel
According to Dibb they're _way_ better than IHOP for pancakes

Also good for lunch

#### First Watch
For breakfast and brunch. Recommended on Dibb

[First Watch website](https://www.firstwatch.com/?version=core){:target="\_blank"}

#### Cheddars Scratch Kitchen
The concept of the "scratch" kitchen seems to be taking off in the US. Basically it means a restaurant where they cook everything from scratch. Revolutionary!!

This is a chain that looks similar to Cracker Barrel and may be worth checking out

[Cheddars Scratch Kitchen website](https://www.cheddars.com/home){:target="\_blank"}

#### Bob Evans
Another one popular on the Dibb. There's one not far from where we stayed previously in Kissimmee

[Bob Evans website](https://www.bobevans.com/menu/){:target="\_blank"}

### Other Options

##### IHOP
Avoid the ones on I-drive and the one attached to a Days Inn, poor experiences on the Dibb

The one near Walgreens on the 192 and the one at Lake Buena Vista are both recommended, by very recent visitors from the Dibb (particularly LBV)

##### Panera Bread
A promising looking breakfast / brunch / lunch type option

[Panera Bread website](https://www.panerabread.com/){:target="\_blank"}

# Independents

#### Yellow Dog Eats
Described as quirky, cozy, unique and difficult to find(!) reviews are pretty good. BBQ, sandwiches, wraps, tacos, nachos, salads and scooby snacks

[website](https://yellowdogeats.com){:target="\_blank"}

#### Maxines on Shine

Community café which gets really good reviews on Tripadvisor
- Brunch Friday - Sunday 10am-3pm
- Dinner  Thursday - Saturday 5pm - 9pm

Menus not available

#### Pom Pom's Tea House and Sandwicheria

Tea (the drink) sandwiches and salads good reviews

[website](http://pompomsteahouse.com){:target="\_blank"}


#### Black Bean Deli

Cuban "comfort food" gets decent professional reviews, Tripadvisor is a little more mixed but also doesn’t have many reviews in general. May be worth checking out

[website](https://blackbeandeli.com){:target="\_blank"}


#### Tako Cheena

Mexican / Asian fusion that started as a food truck
Decent reviews and the menu looks interesting, sounds like it could be worth a visit if not too far away

[website](https://takocheena.net){:target="\_blank"}

#### Bosphorous Turkish Cusine

There are 4 of these - so something of a mini-chain. The lunch menu looks a bit limited (kebabs mostly), the dinner menu looks more interesting. Gets great reviews on TripAdvisor so could be worth checking out as something a bit different from the "typical" Orlando offering

[website](https://www.bosphorousrestaurant.com){:target="\_blank"}

#### The Mexican Camel

A "quick service" restaurant - so somewhere between fast food and normal sit down meals. This place sounds and looks like it's similar to Chipotle but gets great reviews on Tripadvisor. Appears to be a single location on I-Drive and they claim to mix Mexican and Mediterranean cusines, so could be interesting.

[website](https://themexicancamel.com){:target="\_blank"}

#### Tomatoes

Another Turkish / Mediterranean style place. Not many reviews on TripAdvisor and they're all 5 star. Either this place is very new or they're at it. Website also very limited so likely this place would only be worth trying out if it's local

[website](http://tomatoesrestaurants.com){:target="\_blank"}

#### The Gnarly Barley

American sandwiches, tacos and salads. They look like they could be quite good though and get good reviews

[website](https://www.thegnarlybarley.com){:target="\_blank"}

#### Ana's Brazillian Kitchen

Seems to be popular with the local Brazillian expats which has to be a good sign. Check their Facebook page for opening times and details of what's on the menu each day as it seems to change. Looks to be reasonably central and they also get good reviews

[website (Facebook)](https://www.facebook.com/anasbraziliankitchen){:target="\_blank"}

[website with menu](https://www.flowcode.com/page/anasbraziliankitchen){:target="\_blank"}

#### Q'Kenan

Apparently this is a very authentic Venezuelan restaurant. The menu looks interesting and the photos make it look like it could be worth a visit

[website](https://qkenan.com){:target="\_blank"}


# BBQ

## TripAdvisor top 3

### 4 Rivers Smokehouse
One of the top 3 on Tripadvisor, also recommended on Dibb

[website](https://www.4rsmokehouse.com/menu/){:target="\_blank"}

### Pig Floyds
Top recommendation on Tripadvisor but not sure if they're more a large catering type place

[website](https://www.pigfloyds.com/){:target="\_blank"}

### Ellie Lous
Another of the top 3 on Tripadvisor

[website](https://www.ellielous.com/){:target="\_blank"}

## Others

### Lizzies BBQ
Might be a decent option if close but doesn't look spectacular

[website](https://lizziesbbq.com/){:target="\_blank"}

### Bubbalous
Recommended on Dibb but reviews are a bit mixed

[website](https://bubbalous.com/){:target="\_blank"}

### Smokey Bones
According to Dibb they do good ribs

[website](https://smokeybones.com/menu/){:target="\_blank"}

### Polite Pig
Based at Disney Springs

[website](https://www.politepig.com/menu){:target="\_blank"}


# Burgers, Steaks and Americana

### Recommended

#### Longhorn Steakhouse
On I-drive, seems to be the one most frequently recommended. Decent prices and tasty side options

[Longhorn website](https://www.longhornsteakhouse.com/home){:target="\_blank"}	 	

#### Teak Neighborhood Grill
Looks really good - burgers, sandwiches, tacos, salads and flatbreads

[Teak website](https://www.teakorlando.com){:target="\_blank"}

#### Culvers
Burger joint, lots of recommendations. Maybe not quite as varied as Teak but possibly lighter and cheaper

[Culvers website](https://www.culvers.com/menu-and-nutrition){:target="\_blank"}

### Other Options

#### BJs
Might be worth a visit - big menu - maybe too big and varied to be good?
Pizza, burgers, pasta, chicken, steak, lighter stuff, seafood

[BJs website](https://www.bjsrestaurants.com/menu){:target="\_blank"}

#### Manny's Chophouse
Another burger and steak joint, recommended by a couple of people on Dibb
Winter Haven one less busy than Haines?

[Mannys website](https://www.mannyschophouse.com){:target="\_blank"}

#### Logan's Roadhouse
Steak and burger joint

#### Toojays
Looks a little bit different, crazy big sandwiches
Could be worth checking out

[Toojays website](https://www.toojays.com/location/orlando-restaurant-colonial-market-plaza/){:target="\_blank"}

#### Rock n Brew
Another chain, typical American food

[Rock n Brew website](https://www.rockandbrews.com/kissimmee#menu){:target="\_blank"}

### Sickies Garage
Looks like a good burger joint, may be worth checking out

[Sickies website](https://sickiesburgers.com/){:target="\_blank"}

### Hash House a Go Go
Hard to get an idea of the menu other than it looks like country food again (like Cracker Barrel and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen) highly recommended though on the Dibb. Some alternative suggestions on the Dibb that Hash Houses in general are quantity over quality

# Pizza

### Uno
Pizza and grill on International Drive

[Website](https://www.unos.com/menus/){:target="\_blank"}

### NYPD 
Pizza - takeout and sit in

[Locations and website](https://www.nypdpizzeria.com/locations/){:target="\_blank"}

# Other Stuff

## Been Before and Want to Go Back

### Bahama Breeze

[website](https://www.bahamabreeze.com/menu/appetizers/){:target="\_blank"}

### Cheesecake Factory
Needs no explanation. Located at Mall at Millennia
The Susan buster?

[website](https://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/menu){:target="\_blank"}

### Panda Express
American Chinese - slightly downmarket from PF Changs

### Pei Wei
Another American Chinese

[website](https://www.peiwei.com/florida/258-celebration/){:target="\_blank"}

### Zoe's Kitchen
"Mediterranean" food - quick service. Described as a great healthy-ish option for lunch- falafels, hummus, veggies, flatbreads etc

[website](https://zoeskitchen.com){:target="\_blank"}

### Kobe's Steakhouse
Japanese style steakhouse

[website](https://kobesteakhouse.com/menu/){:target="\_blank"}

## Fast Food

- Chick-fil-a (need to remember to try the Polynesian style dipping sauce)
- Publix - good for subs and also for roast or friend chicken to take away. Apparently their coleslaw is good too
- Little Greek Fresh Grill  - upmarket style kebab shop [website](https://littlegreekfreshgrill.com/menu/){:target="\_blank"}
- Snacks at Disney Springs [link to Disney Food Blog](https://www.disneyfoodblog.com/2022/03/21/9-of-the-best-snacks-under-10-in-disney-springs/){:target="\_blank"}
