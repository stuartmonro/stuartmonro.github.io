# Breakfast

### Recommended

#### Cracker Barrel
According to Dibb they're _way_ better than IHOP for pancakes

Also good for lunch

#### First Watch
For breakfast and brunch. Recommended on Dibb

[First Watch website](https://www.firstwatch.com/?version=core){:target="\_blank"}

#### Cheddars Scratch Kitchen
The concept of the "scratch" kitchen seems to be taking off in the US. Basically it means a restaurant where they cook everything from scratch. Revolutionary!!

This is a chain that looks similar to Cracker Barrel and may be worth checking out

#### Bob Evans
Another one popular on the Dibb. There's one not far from where we stayed previously in Kissimmee

### Other Options

##### IHOP
Avoid the ones on I-drive and the one attached to a Days Inn, poor experiences on the Dibb

The one near Walgreens on the 192 and the one at Lake Buena Vista are both recommended, by very recent visitors from the Dibb (particularly LBV)

##### Panera Bread
A promising looking breakfast / brunch / lunch type option

# Burgers Steaks and Americana

### Recommended

#### Longhorn Steakhouse
On I-drive, seems to be the one most frequently recommended. Decent prices and tasty side options

[Longhorn website](https://www.longhornsteakhouse.com/home){:target="\_blank"}	 	

#### Teak Neighborhood Grill
Looks really good - burgers, sandwiches, tacos, salads and flatbreads

[Teak website](https://www.teakorlando.com){:target="\_blank"}

#### Culvers
Burger joint, lots of recommendations. Maybe not quite as varied as Teak but possibly lighter and cheaper

[Culvers website](https://www.culvers.com/menu-and-nutrition){:target="\_blank"}

### Other Options

#### BJs
Might be worth a visit - big menu - maybe too big and varied to be good?
Pizza, burgers, pasta, chicken, steak, lighter stuff, seafood
[BJs website](https://www.bjsrestaurants.com/menu){:target="\_blank"}

#### Manny's Chophouse
Another burger and steak joint, recommended by a couple of people on Dibb
Winter Haven one less busy than Haines?
[Mannys website](https://www.mannyschophouse.com){:target="\_blank"}

#### Logan's Roadhouse
Steak and burger joint

#### Toojays
Looks a little bit different, crazy big sandwiches
Could be worth checking out
[Toojays website](https://www.toojays.com/location/orlando-restaurant-colonial-market-plaza/){:target="\_blank"}

#### Rock n Brew
Another chain, typical American food
[Rock n Brew website](https://www.rockandbrews.com/kissimmee#menu){:target="\_blank"}

### Sickies Garage
Looks like a good burger joint, may be worth checking out
[Sickies website](https://sickiesburgers.com/){:target="\_blank"}

### Hash House a Go Go
Hard to get an idea of the menu other than it looks like country food again (like Cracker Barrel and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen) highly recommended though on the Dibb. Some alternative suggestions on the Dibb that Hash Houses in general are quantity over quality

# Pizza

### Uno
Pizza and grill on International Drive
[Website](https://www.unos.com/menus/){:target="\_blank"}

### NYPD 
Pizza - takeout and sit in
