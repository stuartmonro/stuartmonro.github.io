# Crazy Golf

## Disney

Disney has two mini golf courses and I think these are both included in our Disney tickets. We should check this when we pick the tickets up on day 1. The two courses are:

- [Fantasia Gardens](https://www.disneyworld.co.uk/recreation/fantasia-gardens-fairways-miniature-golf/){:target="\_blank"} 
  - [location](https://goo.gl/maps/gzfYXLAJmRYs3VCH6){:target="\_blank"}
- [Winter Summerland](https://www.disneyworld.co.uk/recreation/winter-summerland-miniature-golf/){:target="\_blank"} 
  - [location](https://goo.gl/maps/Qw413KUNVaNqowtq7){:target="\_blank"}

## Congo River Golf
Think this is the one next door to where we stayed last time we were there. According to TripAdvisor it's the number 1 mini golf course in the area

## Pirates Cove

On international drive, close to Se&ntilde;or Frogs and Bahama Breeze

[website](https://www.piratescove.net/locations/florida/orlando/){:target="\_blank"}

There are two locations - [this one near Old Town Kissimmee](https://goo.gl/maps/nNLwzC13JpgoJR6T8){:target="\_blank"}

[and this one on International Drive](https://goo.gl/maps/nNLwzC13JpgoJR6T8){:target="\_blank"}

## Hawaiian Rumble

Another one rated on TripAdvisor, people also seem to get excited by the gift shop here

# Places to Visit


### Celebration
Supposedly this is a little bit nicer than Old Town Kissimmee. It's basically somewhere to go for a wander round, shopping, dining and a farmer's market every Sunday. 

Apparently parking in the shopping area is pretty easy, except at really busy times it should be possible to park (for free) on Front Street or Market Street. If parking kerbside, always make sure to park in the direction of travel. There's also apparently "acres" of free parking behind the shops on both sides of Market Street - this is basically the parking lot for the Celebration Town Centre shopping centre [link here](https://g.page/celebrationtowncenter?share){:target="\_blank"} or at the back of Upper Crust Pizza. 

[Kilwins](https://www.kilwins.com/stores/kilwins-celebration){:target="\_blank"} supposedly do good ice cream and going for a drive around the neighbourhoods is recommended just to see the way the houses are set out and decorated. Jeeter Bend neighbourhood is mentioned a few times.

### Old Town Kissimmee
Recreation of a "classic" Florida town with old style architecture and shop fronts. 18 acres of shops, restaurants, bars, rides 
Classic car show & cruise every  Friday and Saturday with live music and food trucks. Usually muscle cars on Friday and classic cars / hot rods on Saturday. Need to get there early for free parking on car show night. See below for some suggestions from Dibb on free car parking. A little tacky but loads of fun with local "colour" from the nearby trailer parks on car show night too.
Can get very busy on car show evenings, people have said it's a half day trip but can be a bit quiet away from the weekend - maybe that's a good thing?

Apparently if we do go, we should check out Flippers Pizza


*There’s a large car park near the amusements/rides (sorry can’t remember the name of it). In 2019 I think we were $10 but it saved a lot of time searching for a spot. I think there’s also a free car park next to the car exhibits.*

*You can pay $10 to park just behind Red Lobster - we were going their for a meal so didn't get charged. There was a lot of (free I think) parking spaces all along the roads around the side, so might be worth a drive past to see if you can nab one.*

[Details on the web](https://myoldtownusa.com/category/events/){:target="\_blank"}


### Weikwa Springs
A state park, would give something of a change of pace. Hiking, swimming, picnics, paddling and viewing wildlife. 

[Park website here](https://www.floridastateparks.org/parks-and-trails/wekiwa-springs-state-park){:target="\_blank"}

### Boat Hire at Disney
It's possible to hire boats to pootle around the big lake at Disney and take in the sights from a different perspective. There's a [thread about it on the Dibb](https://www.thedibb.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=1228040){:target="\_blank"} and more details available from the [Disney website](https://www.disneyworld.co.uk/recreation/motorized-boats/){:target="\_blank"}. Looks like it costs $45 per half hour



# Beaches and the Coast

If we're going to visit a beach or seaside town, the recommendation is to avoid the weekends as it can be pretty busy with bad traffic delays.

### Cocoa Beach
Might be worth combining with a trip to NASA

[Somewhere to park](https://www.visitspacecoast.com/cocoa-beach/things-to-do/lori-wilson-park){:target="\_blank"}

[Somewhere to eat (key lime pie)](https://flkeylimepies.com/){:target="\_blank"}

[Somewhere to shop](https://www.ronjonsurfshop.com/location/detail.aspx?LocationId=7){:target="\_blank"} - close to the Key Lime Pie place

### John's Pass
Apparently John's Pass - just south of Clearwater is really nice & quite laid back compared to Clearwater

[Johns Pass website](https://www.johnspass.com){:target="\_blank"}

There's a pirate ship tour, pirates and frozen custard

[Pirates](https://youtu.be/O3s-F4hhMgc){:target="\_blank"}

Dolphin spotting boat trips are also available in the area

[Dolphins](https://www.johnspass.com/family-entertainment/madeira-beach/tampa-bay-dolphin-tours/){:target="\_blank"}	

### Clearwater Beach
About 1h 45m from Kissimmee and has dolphin spotting boats.
Little Toot at Clearwater recommended on Dibb for dolphin spotting boats, but also recommends we book in advance as they sell out $25.23 each. Supposedly you can sometimes spot dolphins from the pier

# Rainy Day Options

- Dezerland Park looks like it could be fun
  - [website here](https://dezerlandpark.com/orlando/){:target="\_blank"} 
  
- Orlando Science Centre - looks similar to Glasgow so more kid oriented, but might be an option
	- [website here](https://www.osc.org){:target="\_blank"}
  
- Cinema - Universal are currently offering free parking if you buy 2 or more cinema tickets for showings before 6pm
