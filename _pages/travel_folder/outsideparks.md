# NASA

We have tickets booked for [Kennedy Space Centre](https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com){:target="\_blank"}

# Places to Visit


### Celebration
Supposedly this is a little bit nicer than Old Town Kissimmee. It's basically somewhere to go for a wander round, shopping, dining and a farmer's market every Sunday.

### Old Town Kissimmee
Recreation of a "classic" Florida town with old style architecture and shop fronts. 18 acres of shops, restaurants, bars, rides 
Classic car show & cruise every  Friday and Saturday with live music and food trucks. Usually muscle cars on Friday and classic cars / hot rods on Saturday. Need to get there early for free parking on car show night. See below for some suggestions from Dibb on free car parking. A little tacky but loads of fun with local "colour" from the nearby trailer parks on car show night too.
Can get very busy on car show evenings, people have said it's a half day trip but can be a bit quiet away from the weekend - maybe that's a good thing?

Apparently if we do go, we should check out Flippers Pizza


*There’s a large car park near the amusements/rides (sorry can’t remember the name of it). In 2019 I think we were $10 but it saved a lot of time searching for a spot. I think there’s also a free car park next to the car exhibits.*

*You can pay $10 to park just behind Red Lobster - we were going their for a meal so didn't get charged. There was a lot of (free I think) parking spaces all along the roads around the side, so might be worth a drive past to see if you can nab one.*

### Weikwa Springs
A state park, would give something of a change of pace. Hiking, swimming, picnics, paddling and viewing wildlife.
