Epcot and the water parks are usually busier at the weekends. We should also try to avoid extra magic hours days in the parks [link to extra hours details](https://www.disneyworld.eu/guest-services/extended-evening/){:target="\_blank"}.

The following sites provide some form of busy day guide, how accurate these are post covid and in the Genie+ days is yet to be seen:

- [Touring plans (we have a subscription to this)](https://touringplans.com/universal-orlando/touring-plans){:target="\_blank"}
- [DIBB busy day guide](https://DIBB.in/15346564){:target="\_blank"}
