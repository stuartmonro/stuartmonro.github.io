Epcot and the water parks are usually busier at the weekends. We should also try to avoid extra magic hours days in the parks [link to extra hours details](https://www.disneyworld.eu/guest-services/extended-evening/){:target="\_blank"}.

The following sites provide some form of busy day guide, how accurate these are post covid and in the Genie+ days is yet to be seen:

The opening times for the other parks are below. We have tickets to Universal which covers Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure and Volcano Bay. Our Disney ticket will also cover entry to Typhoon Lagoon. Sadly it seems that Disney's Blizzard Beach is closed this year. Disney Springs isn;t a park, more an eating and shopping area but well worth visiting. Universal has something similar called CityWalk which we have to walk through to get into the Universal parks, so it doesn't need to be covered separately. CityWalk is open from 8am to midnight every day

|Park|Open|Close|
|--------|--------|--------|
| Disney Springs|10:00 |23:00 |
| Typhoon Lagoon | 10:00 |19:00 |
| Universal Studios|09:00 |21:00 |
