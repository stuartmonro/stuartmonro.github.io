This whole page is copied from a post on the Dibb forum which really outlines everything we need to know about Genie plus

For those who don't know much about how G+ works yet, I posted this on another thread and thought it might be useful here too.

There seems to be some confusion thinking that you can only book a ride every 2 hours, and that's not the case. This is a strategy that's really useful for stacking rides for later in the day if you don't plan to get there for park opening using the 2 hour rule. I've tried to explain it more below.

- You can either buy it in advance at a discounted rate of around £100, but have to buy it for the whole 14 days of your ticket, or you can buy it as you need it for $15+ tax per person, per day.

- The breakeven point of buying in advance is around 8-9 days, depending on the exchange rate.
- Most agree that it's not really needed at AK or EP.

- If you decide to buy as you use, then it goes on sale at midnight.

- You can park hop with G+ so can use it in all the parks on the same day, subject to availability. For your second park you can only book them for after 2pm.

- It doesn't include all of the rides in each park. There are 2 rides per park (1 until 7th August) that you can choose to either pay for separately, or use the standby queue. These are ROTR, FOP, SFMT, Remy, although I expect that will change to Guardians when it opens. These are called Individual Lightning Lane Selections, or ILLS (or fancy rides if you watch Molly from Allears).

Booking for G+ opens at 7am on the day you want to go for everyone, regardless of whether you're onsite or offsite.
</span>

- Booking for ILLS opens at 7am for onsite guests, and at park opening for offsite guests. ROTR usually sells out within minutes at 7am.

<span style="color:green">
For G+ you can book one at a time and for the next available time. You cannot chose your time like you could with FP+.
</span>

- For ILLS, you can choose your time, but can only book a max of 2 per day across all the parks (not sure if this has been reduced to 1 until 7th August)

<span style="color:green">
You can book your next G+ either after you tap in for the one you have, or after 2 hours if your current one is more than 2 hours away from the time you booked it.
</span>

EG: at 7am, you book a ride for 9.30am. You tap in at 9.30am, and then can book another one straight away.
OR
At 7am you book a ride for 12pm. 2 hours after park opening, you can book another one, so at 11am if the park opened at 9am.

 
Morning stacking doesn't really work that well, if at all. First off, if you book at 7am (or between 7am and the time the park opens), the next time you can book isn't 9am, it's 2 hours after the park opens. So, if it opens at 9am, and you've booked your first ride for 10am, you will be able to book your next ride after you've tapped in for that one. That will continue unless you trigger the 2 hour rule - so if the next ride you've booked is more than 2 hours away, you can book another one 2 hours after booking that one.

Stacking works much better for afternoon/evening visits as you can book one at 7am, then the next 2 hours after the park opens, so let's say 11am, then 1pm, then 3pm etc.

<span style="color:green">
If you're just doing a morning, the best option is to book your first one as close to park opening time as possible. After you tap in, you can then book another, then tap in, book again and repeat. You'll get much better use of G+ that way, especially if you can avoid booking one that's more than 2 hours away and triggering the 2 hour rule.

- Two hour rule: if you book a ride that's more than 2 hours away, you can then book another one. Eg: at 7am you booked a ride at 9.30am.You tap in for that, but the next available ride you want isn't until 12pm, so you book that. 2 hours after the time you booked, you can then book another one, so at 11.30am.

<span style="color:green">
A good tip is that if you lose track or get totally lost about when you can book your next ride just try to book one, and if it’s not time yet a screen will pop up showing the time you can book your next one.


You can stack G+ which is useful if you want to go to a park in the afternoon or evening. Eg: book your first ride at 7am. Then 2 hours after park opening, you can book another, so at 11am if the park opens at 9am. 2 hours after that, you can book another, so at 1pm, 2 hours after that at 3pm, you can book another, and so on. So if you plan an afternoon/evening visit, you could potentially have 4-5 rides booked up, all subject to availability.

- G+ rides do book up. So, although in theory you can book a lot, it all depends on what's available. The bigger, more popular rides book up much quicker. For example SDD normally sells out within minutes at 7am. They may pop up during the day, but can be hard to grab. So, you may only be left with options for smaller rides that don't have much of a queue anyway, or that you're not actually interested in.

- You can look at ride availability and times in the G+ section of the MDE app. It can be quite interesting to check it at different times of the day to see what availability is like.

<span style="color:green">
The terms lightning lane (LL) and Individual Lightning Lane selection (ILLS) can cause confusion. The Lightning Lane is just the physical entrance that you will use at the ride. All rides have then, so every standard G+ ride you book will be entered through the lightning lane entrance for that ride. When you book the additional paid for rides that are called ILLS, you will enter the ride through the lightning lane entrance.
</span>

- You do not have to buy G+ in order to book ILLS. You can book them separately.

I've found the best way to learn and understand it has been to watch the vlogs that Molly at Allears has done. There was a loophole at the beginning of its release that allowed you to book more, but that was closed at the end of November, so vlogs after that would be the most accurate, but some of the early ones explain the basics well too
