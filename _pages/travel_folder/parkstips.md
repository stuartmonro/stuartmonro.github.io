# Timing

Although the crowds this year are generally accepted to be mental, there are a few things worth considering - it will still always be less busy during the week than at the weekend

We should make a list of the things we'd like to do before we go into the MK - it’s unlikely we'll be able to do everything in one day, but we also don't want to be zig-zagging across the park

We should look to be sitting outside the TTC an hour before the park opens because we have to get parked, get through security & ticketing & get over to the park entrance. TTC usually only opens around 45min - 1 hour before the park opens

When entering the park, scan the security entrances and look for ones with shorter queues - they will exist

Rope drop is still the best strategy for doing some of the bigger attractions before it gets really busy and really hot. Recommendation at MK is to rope drop 7 dwarves mine train or splash mountain - head for them as soon as the rope drop happens

- Early in the morning & late in the evening probably the best times.
- Other options could be around lunch and dinner time - 11:30am & 6pm
- During shows including the parades during the day and the night time spectaculars

Busy times in the parks are usually from around 10am - 6 - 8pm
The parks tend to empty out after fireworks

#### Splash Mountain
If splash mountain doesn’t open on time (a common occurrence) hit the pirates of the Caribbean or jungle cruise. Jungle cruise is a good one to hit early because it’s a lot more popular just now as a result of the movie
Early in the morning, Pirates should be quite a short queue as well, worth looking at after Jungle Cruise
Splash Mountain will sit at around a 60 min wait for most of the day, so try and get it early (or G+ it)

#### Seven Dwarves Mine Train
Seven Dwarves Mine Train, Haunted Mansion and Peter Pan's Flight are the "other side" or other option for rides to hit at rope drop

Space Mountain less worth it for rope drop as the lines for that will drop later in the day to around 45 min

Don't go far from an attraction that has closed for technical difficulties, when it re-opens you can jump in line without much of a wait - keep an eye on MDE - as soon as you see a wait time posted that means it has opened again

## Hollywood Studios
Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular - worth using G+ for

## Epcot
Frozen Ever After - If we really want to go on this ride, head there straight at rope drop as most people will be scrambling to get on Remy's Ratatouille adventure then

# Filler Attractions

- Shows projected on the Chinese Theatre at the end of the night

# Taking a Break
Go into some of the less crowded shows like Carousel of Progress, Hall of Presidents to get a chance to sit down in air conditioned room for a while (around 20 min usually)
This is likely a better option than trying to find a restaurant to sit down in, though that will work too

Tom Sawyer's island is also a nice spot to take a break

Epcot is a slower pace and more spread out

Discuss a meeting point at the start of the day as somewhere we can regroup if we get separated

Alternatively, leave the park and come back later - looks like mid to late morning might be a quieter time to get back in, but middle of the day is also the hottest part of the day and busiest
Going out of the park early to mid afternoon for a meal is a good way to plan to be inside when it rains
	
Late afternoon, early evening (tea time) is a good time to hit the park again as a lot of people head out to get dinner

# Weather
It will rain at some point every day, usually afternoon or evening - have some undercover plans up the sleeve. Plan some longer indoor attractions for the afternoon or go out of the park in the afternoon for a meal

Bear in mind that when it rains all of the outdoor attractions will close & so the wait times for indoor attractions will skyrocket

# Fireworks
If staying for the fireworks show in the park, hold back after the end of the show before trying to leave (like allow at least half an hour) because the crowds are mental - go and do another ride - wait times will drop after the fireworks

Some food outlets stay open up to an hour after park close time, order something for mobile pick up for after the show (away from where the crowds might be) then wander round & people watch while waiting for the crush at the exit to subside

Can also join a queue for a ride just before park close time and you should get on

A decent spot to watch the fireworks from (and also to make a sharp exit afterwards) is at the back of Main Street USA where you can see right down the street to the castle, next to the gates

Alternatively, at the back of the castle hub behind the partners statue - you can see all of the fireworks plus the projections

Also think about what we did before which was to leave as the show starts and watch it all from the back of the ferry

OR - if you care less about the projections and just want to see the fireworks, go to the back of Fantasyland and watch from behind the carousel

# Food in the Parks
If mobile order "vanishes" from the main screen in MDE, it should still be available in the mobile food orders menu

Swirls on the Water at Disney Springs sells Dole Whips

If we must get snacks before fireworks - try some of the mobile carts outside of the main street area for little or no wait

# Genie+ and Lightning Lanes
Check LL availability before paying for G+
Do this by checking the Disney Genie tip board 
Don't forget that return windows will change throughout the day

LL become available to book from 7am (may be later if not staying on property)

Look for DFBGuide Vlog on G+

G+ can be used in more than one park per day if you want to go park hopping - don’t forget that park hopping needs a reservation

# Other Things to Do
Check out disneyfoodblog.com/funandfree 

Hoe down in front of Country Bear Jamboree in Frontierland - watch the cast members and characters do some line dancing, not set time so ask cast members when the Hoe Down is happening

Guest relations in the park will hand out free celebration buttons (badges) should get some 1st timer ones for Susan and Ally

At Castle Couture in Magic Kingdom cast members will pixie dust you (cover you in glitter) for free if you ask

Parades and Shows

Magic Kingdom - main street trolley show 9:15, 10:10 & midday

Most parades aren't happening, instead they’re doing Cavalcades which will be smaller than parades but more frequent. Check out MDE for details

# Getting Around
If we want to visit a Disney resort or hotel (such as Boardwalk) we can't park there unless we're staying there or have a dining reservation. So the best bet is to use Disney's transportation services. Go to the travel and transport hub and get whatever transport we need from there. Best to co-incide this with a day when we've already paid to park on Disney property (e.g. at a theme park).

Arrive at the park at least 30 min before rope drop (also need to factor in the time to park, the time to get from the car park to the entry and the time to get through security - so don’t rock up at the car park 30 min before opening) Recommendations from DFB is to get to the park 30 min before you think you'll be able to get in
Parking opens 1.5 hours before official opening time
Going to the Magic Kingdom, parking is at the transportation & ticket centre, we need to allow time to get from there to the park itself - either by ferry, bus or monorail

# Shopping in the Parks
Get ponchos / rain gear before going into the parks - $1 per poncho vs $14

Sunscreen is extortionate in the parks, as is medicine like pain killers. You can however, get single portions of over the counter medicine for free at the first aid stations
	
Star Wars shops in Hollywood Studios (Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge) - this gets really crowded cos it's quite a small, enclosed space. Try to avoid the crowds by going early morning or late afternoon
